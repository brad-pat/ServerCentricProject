# ServerCentricProject
My coursework from Server Centric and Cloud Computing Module.

This is a year 3 piece of coursework from my university. This project was based on Server-Centric programming. Use of RESTful, JAX and External Web services were used in order to gather information about stocks and shares. This information was then presented in a client for the user to interact with and use.

The programming element of this Module got a 1st overall.
